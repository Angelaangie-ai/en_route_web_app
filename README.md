### 📢 Step 1: Open up the application

You can find the web version on the link: [https://enroute-3dd40.web.app/#welcome_screen](https://enroute-3dd40.web.app/#welcome_screen).

### 📢 Step 2: Register

**✋Attention: Don't click on Log In With Google - Please proceed through the Register Button.**

**Register by using the same email in the previous survey**, so that we could contact you! And we don't want to miss on our climate heroes!

### 📢 Step 3: How do you want to help Planet Earth?

**Welcome dear, let's rock on!** In this kit, we will go step-by-step to all the application structures, so I suggest you follow us and explore together!

### 📢 Step 4: Make your daily combination

What you see here is the place where your activities will show. **Click on the plus below to add a certain activity.**

🗣️ **At this point, the process of adding activity is not functioning in the web application. Please check the video to understand the process.**

Click on the back button to continue. In the **Make Your Daily Combination** you have an example how a result of this process would look like i.e. how you will receive a personalized combo with the least CO2 emissions.

Click on each activity to see how you can buy tickets or navigate.

After the software concludes a finished activity, you would be able to get the point by clicking on the dollar sign.

### 📢 Step 5: Sustainable clothes

On **Enter a link** you would be able to scan the barcode of any clothes/food/cosmetics product or add their online links.

In this version to foresee the result, tap on the **See Result** button.

For each product you scan, you will receive detailed information if the product is sustainable or not. Moreover, you will receive products similar in price and type, but more sustainable (as the bags shown below.)

When you click on them, you can foresee a online shop feature.

If you want it to buy online, you can click on add to cart and proceed. If you want to buy it live, you can check it via the shop locator. After you buy it online (and still searching ways for validating offline shopping, you can proceed with the point on the dollar sign)

### 📢 Step 6: Social Challenges

Let's compete who saved more CO2 emissions. When the application would be up and running, you could foresee all your friends' results on: **See live scoreboard**.

🗣️**YOU CAN SHARE ON SOCIAL MEDIA RIGHT NOW!** Click the white circle two times on the specific social media, and after that click on the activity.

### 📢 Step 7: Sustainable Food

Here, we'd like to give an overview of the "hot" eco-friendly dishes around you (according to the location)

Clicking on a certain dish will give you information about the restaurant and a way to order food.

### 📢 Step 8: Eco-friendly education

It is important to learn why certain things take place. In order to better understand the upcoming danger, we've put several courses for EnRoute users to follow.

### 📢 Step 9: Reward Yourself

You've worked hard to make Planet Earth a better place and now it is time to reward yourself. 

🗣️Here we have put just one example, but the EnRoute Online Shop will include a lot more sustainable things for you to receive.

The app was created with Dart and Flutter, and was published in January, 2021.
